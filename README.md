# Accidental Drug Related Deaths - Data Science Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Accidental Drug Related Deaths** project is a Data Science initiative that analyzes accidental deaths caused by drug consumption in Connecticut. Using real-world data from open government sources, this project aims to extract valuable insights through data processing, exploratory analysis, and unsupervised learning techniques.

## 📊 Key Components
This project consists of several Jupyter notebooks that cover different stages of the Data Science workflow:

### 📥 Data Wrangling
Extracts and processes data from open government sources.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzes trends, distributions, and key patterns in the dataset.

### 🤖 Machine Learning Model
Develops a Clustering model to identify patterns and group similar cases of drug-related incidents.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from open government records and includes various features such as:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Race
- **Location:** City, County, Coordinates
- **Incident Details:** Substance type (Fentanyl, Heroin, Cocaine, etc.), Time of Death, Place of Incident

## 📈 Machine Learning Model
The Clustering model is designed to uncover hidden patterns in the data and group similar cases based on multiple risk factors. Different clustering algorithms are tested to achieve optimal segmentation and insights.

## 🔥 Insights & Findings
- **Trends in drug-related fatalities** over time and location.
- **High-risk substances** that contribute most to fatalities.
- **Clusters of incidents** that share similar characteristics.
